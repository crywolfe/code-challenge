###INITIAL COMMENTS

I initially wrote the code a little differently.  However, I thought it best to refactor the code to provide more proper organization.

###TESTING - RSPEC, TRAVIS

After writing the code, I thought I should provide documentation other than the short comments contained in the code.  What better way to document than to document with tests, so, I wrote three rspec tests.

I used travis to make it more convenient for you so that you would not have to run rspec.
