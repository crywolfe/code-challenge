yodle-challenge
===============

###INITIAL COMMENTS

I initially wrote the code without using classes or methods because it was short enough to do so.  However, in order to show you my abilities in writing code with proper classes and methods I refactored the code.

###RSPEC

After writing the code, I thought I should provide documentation other than comments contained in the code.  What better way to document than to document with tests.  I wrote three rspec tests for the three methods the program contains.

###JAVASCRIPT CODING CHALLENGE
I also finished the first three javascript coding challenges.  When we talk, I can walk you through how I solved those problems.

###REFACTORING TO DOS
1.  I would like the traverse method to be shorter
2.  I would like to create a menu to give the user the option the user to search for the minimum sum.

###FOLLOW UP
I'm looking forward to our call on Tuesday.
