#INITIAL COMMENTS

I initially wrote the code without using classes or methods because it was short enough to do so.  However, in order to show my abilities in writing code with proper classes and methods I refactored the code to do so.

#RSPEC

After writing the code, I thought I should provide documentation other than comments contained in the code.  So, I thought what better way to document than to document with tests.  I wrote three rspec tests for the three methods the program contains.

#JAVASCRIPT CODING CHALLENGE
I also finished the first three javascript coding challenges.  When we talk, I can walk you through how I solved those problems.

#FOLLOW UP
I'm looking forward to our call on Tuesday.
