yodle-challenge
===============

###INITIAL COMMENTS

I initially wrote the code without using classes or methods because it was short enough to do so.  However, in order to show you my abilities in writing code with proper classes and methods I refactored the code.

###RSPEC

After writing the code, I thought I should provide documentation other than the short comments contained in the code.  What better way to document than to document with tests!  I wrote three rspec tests for the three methods the program contains.

###JAVASCRIPT CODING CHALLENGE
I also finished all the JS coding challenges, including the bonus.  I included the code for the bonus in this repo.  It is called yodle_change.rb.  When we talk, I can walk you through how I solved all of the JS problems.

###REFACTORING AND ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY - TO DOS
1.  Shorten traverse method
2.  Create a menu to give the user the option to search for the minimum sum and implement it.
3.  Add JS to provide a visual representation of the highlighted tree path.

###FOLLOW UP
I'm looking forward to our call on Tuesday.
