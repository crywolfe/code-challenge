yodle_code_challenge
===============

###INITIAL COMMENTS

I initially wrote the code without using classes or methods because it was short enough to do so.  However, I thought it best to refactor the code to provide more proper organization.

###TESTING - RSPEC, TRAVIS

After writing the code, I thought I should provide documentation other than the short comments contained in the code.  What better way to document than to document with tests, so, I wrote three rspec tests.

I used travis to make it more convenient for you so that you would not have to run rspec.

###JAVASCRIPT CODING CHALLENGE
I also finished all the JS coding challenges, including the bonus.  I included the code for the bonus in this repo.  It is called yodle_change.rb.  When we talk, I can walk you through how I solved all of the JS problems.

###FOLLOW UP
I'm looking forward to our call tomorrow.
